/**
 * An ImageTile is really useful because it is a large image that contains all the images
 * to be used in the program. It is a way to save and not increase the number
 * from resource files.
 * Important: all the images contained in the original image must have the same size
 * width and height.
 * As it is an image type, it inherits from the <class>Image</class> class.
